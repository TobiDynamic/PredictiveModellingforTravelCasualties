<h1>Road Casualty Insight Analysis</h1>

 ### [YouTube Demonstration](https://youtu.be/7eJexJVCqJo)

<h2>Description</h2>
In this project, I utilized SQL to perform an initial ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process, extracting 3.01 million records and 21 variables from raw datasets. This step involved cleansing and transforming the data to ensure accuracy and consistency. The analysis then focused on comparing casualty rates across regions, time of day, and road types, including fatal, serious, and slight casualties. By identifying key KPIs such as casualty trends and location-based risk factors, I developed predictive models that enabled the identification of high-risk areas, aiding in strategic decision-making to improve road safety.
